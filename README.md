# calcite-nix
calcite.cc is a great minecraft server that i run, this is the configuration.nix file that does all the magic, it has a shitton of stuff and im just hosting the lastest version of the nix file here
removed some stuff but if you are here i think you know how to configure this shit
ive added a guide at the start of the file telling you what to change
have fun! i love nixOS
this config file is intended for a HP ProDesk 600 G4 Mini, Intel Core i5-8500T 2.10 - 3.50GHz with 32gb of ram and 512gb of storage with a double SSD config, you WILL have to change a lot of stuff
i say honestly just ask claude or some shit to change it for ur own server, ignoring that this config is a perfect base for selfhosted minecraft servers
