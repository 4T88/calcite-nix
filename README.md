# calcite-nix
calcite.cc is a great minecraft server that i run, this is the configuration.nix file that does all the magic, it has a shitton of stuff and im just hosting the lastest version of the nix file here
removed some stuff but if you are here i think you know how to configure this shit
ive added a guide at the start of the file telling you what to change
have fun! i love nixOS
